# YC Team Notes - Floyo

**Last Updated:** 2025-01-20  
**Status:** Draft - Founders to fill in real team information

---

## Team Information from Repository

### Founders / Core Team

> **TODO:** Founders to fill in:
> - Names and roles
> - Backgrounds (previous companies, schools, notable achievements)
> - Why this team is uniquely qualified to build Floyo
> - Division of responsibilities (who does product/eng/GTM)

**Inferred from Repository:**
- Repository structure suggests **1-3 person team** (based on commit patterns, file organization)
- Strong technical execution (comprehensive codebase, good architecture)
- Full-stack capabilities (Python backend, TypeScript frontend, DevOps)
- Product-focused (extensive documentation, user research in `/docs/ICP_AND_JTBD.md`)

---

## Role Split (Inferred)

### Engineering
- **Backend:** Python/FastAPI expertise (evident from codebase quality)
- **Frontend:** Next.js/React/TypeScript expertise (modern stack)
- **DevOps:** CI/CD, Supabase, Vercel deployment (automated workflows)
- **Data:** Database design, analytics infrastructure (comprehensive schema)

### Product
- **User Research:** Extensive ICP/JTBD documentation suggests product thinking
- **Design:** UI/UX considerations (privacy-first, developer-focused)
- **Strategy:** GTM materials, market vision documents

### GTM / Business
- **GTM Strategy:** `/docs/GTM_MATERIALS.md` suggests business thinking
- **Pricing:** Subscription tiers defined (Free/Pro/Enterprise)
- **Market Research:** Market sizing, competitive analysis

**Assumption:** Likely **technical founders** (2-3 people) who can build and have product sense, but may need to hire for GTM/sales.

## Founder Stories Suggested by Repository

### Story 1: "We Built This Because We Needed It"
**Evidence:**
- Privacy-first design suggests founders care about privacy
- Developer-focused features suggest founders are developers
- Tool sprawl problem suggests founders experienced this pain

**Narrative:**
> "We were juggling 15+ tools building our previous startup. We wasted hours manually syncing data, couldn't remember which tools we actually used, and missed integration opportunities. We built Floyo to solve our own problem—and discovered thousands of others have the same pain."

---

### Story 2: "We've Built Complex Systems Before"
**Evidence:**
- Comprehensive codebase (backend, frontend, CLI, migrations, CI/CD)
- Good architecture (separation of concerns, privacy controls, compliance features)
- Production-ready infrastructure (monitoring, error tracking, analytics)

**Narrative:**
> "We've built production systems before. We know how to scale, how to handle privacy, how to build developer tools. Floyo isn't our first rodeo—it's the product of years of experience building tools that developers actually use."

---

### Story 3: "We Move Fast and Ship"
**Evidence:**
- Automated CI/CD (GitHub Actions → Vercel)
- Comprehensive testing (unit tests, E2E tests)
- Good documentation (extensive `/docs` folder)
- Self-healing systems (MASTER OMEGA PRIME, Aurora Prime)

**Narrative:**
> "We ship fast. We've built Floyo from idea to production-ready in [X months]. We have automated testing, CI/CD, monitoring—everything needed to move fast without breaking things."

---

## Previous Projects / Side Tools

### Internal Tools (Visible in Repo)

1. **MASTER OMEGA PRIME** (`/scripts/master-omega-prime.ts`)
   - Autonomous orchestrator for full-stack systems
   - Suggests founders have experience building automation tools
   - **Story:** "We built internal tools to manage our own stack—now we're productizing it"

2. **Aurora Prime** (`/scripts/aurora-prime.ts`)
   - Infrastructure health monitoring
   - Suggests founders care about reliability
   - **Story:** "We built monitoring tools for ourselves—now we're building them for everyone"

3. **Unified Agent** (`/unified-agent/`)
   - Multi-agent orchestration system
   - Suggests founders have experience with AI/automation
   - **Story:** "We've been building automation systems—Floyo is the culmination"

## Technical Credibility

### Code Quality Indicators

✅ **Good Architecture:**
- Separation of concerns (backend, frontend, CLI)
- Database migrations properly managed
- API design follows REST conventions
- Type safety (TypeScript, Pydantic models)

✅ **Production Readiness:**
- Error tracking (Sentry integration)
- Analytics (PostHog integration)
- Monitoring (metrics aggregation jobs)
- Security (RLS policies, privacy controls)
- Testing (unit tests, E2E tests)

✅ **Developer Experience:**
- Comprehensive documentation
- Clear setup instructions
- Automated CI/CD
- Good error messages

**Conclusion:** Founders demonstrate **strong technical execution** and **production-ready thinking**.

## Suggested Founder Stories (If True)

### If Founders Are Ex-Google/Meta/Amazon Engineers:
> "We built infrastructure at [Big Tech]. We know how to scale, how to handle privacy, how to build tools developers trust. Floyo is our chance to build something that actually helps developers—not just serves ads."

### If Founders Are Ex-Startup Founders:
> "We built [Previous Startup] and sold it/raised $X. We learned that tool sprawl kills productivity. Floyo is our second act—solving a problem we experienced firsthand."

### If Founders Are Indie Hackers:
> "We've been building tools for ourselves for years. We built Floyo to solve our own problem—and discovered thousands of others have the same pain. We're bootstrapped, profitable, and growing."

### If Founders Are First-Time Founders:
> "We're first-time founders, but we've been building tools for years. We're technical, we move fast, and we're solving a problem we know deeply. We're ready to learn GTM and scale."
