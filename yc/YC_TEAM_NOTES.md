- **DevOps:** CI/CD, Supabase, Vercel deployment (automated workflows)
- **Data:** Database design, analytics infrastructure (comprehensive schema)

### Product
- **User Research:** Extensive ICP/JTBD documentation suggests product thinking
- **Design:** UI/UX considerations (privacy-first, developer-focused)
- **Strategy:** GTM materials, market vision documents

### GTM / Business
- **GTM Strategy:** `/docs/GTM_MATERIALS.md` suggests business thinking
- **Pricing:** Subscription tiers defined (Free/Pro/Enterprise)
- **Market Research:** Market sizing, competitive analysis

**Assumption:** Likely **technical founders** (2-3 people) who can build and have product sense, but may need to hire for GTM/sales.

## Founder Stories Suggested by Repository

### Story 1: "We Built This Because We Needed It"
**Evidence:**
- Privacy-first design suggests founders care about privacy
- Developer-focused features suggest founders are developers
- Tool sprawl problem suggests founders experienced this pain

**Narrative:**
> "We were juggling 15+ tools building our previous startup. We wasted hours manually syncing data, couldn't remember which tools we actually used, and missed integration opportunities. We built Floyo to solve our own problem—and discovered thousands of others have the same pain."

---

### Story 2: "We've Built Complex Systems Before"
**Evidence:**
- Comprehensive codebase (backend, frontend, CLI, migrations, CI/CD)
- Good architecture (separation of concerns, privacy controls, compliance features)
- Production-ready infrastructure (monitoring, error tracking, analytics)

**Narrative:**
> "We've built production systems before. We know how to scale, how to handle privacy, how to build developer tools. Floyo isn't our first rodeo—it's the product of years of experience building tools that developers actually use."

---

### Story 3: "We Move Fast and Ship"
**Evidence:**
- Automated CI/CD (GitHub Actions → Vercel)
- Comprehensive testing (unit tests, E2E tests)
- Good documentation (extensive `/docs` folder)
- Self-healing systems (MASTER OMEGA PRIME, Aurora Prime)

**Narrative:**
> "We ship fast. We've built Floyo from idea to production-ready in [X months]. We have automated testing, CI/CD, monitoring—everything needed to move fast without breaking things."

---

## Suggested Founder Stories (If True)

### If Founders Are Ex-Google/Meta/Amazon Engineers:
> "We built infrastructure at [Big Tech]. We know how to scale, how to handle privacy, how to build tools developers trust. Floyo is our chance to build something that actually helps developers—not just serves ads."

### If Founders Are Ex-Startup Founders:
> "We built [Previous Startup] and sold it/raised $X. We learned that tool sprawl kills productivity. Floyo is our second act—solving a problem we experienced firsthand."

### If Founders Are Indie Hackers:
> "We've been building tools for ourselves for years. We built Floyo to solve our own problem—and discovered thousands of others have the same pain. We're bootstrapped, profitable, and growing."

### If Founders Are First-Time Founders:
> "We're first-time founders, but we've been building tools for years. We're technical, we move fast, and we're solving a problem we know deeply. We're ready to learn GTM and scale."

## Why This Team?

**Unique Insight:**
> Scott has built multiple automation and monitoring systems (MASTER OMEGA PRIME, Aurora Prime, Unified Agent) and experienced firsthand the problem of tool sprawl and manual workflow management. The insight: Developers and small business operators waste hours daily on manual work, but don't know what can be automated because they don't see the patterns in their own usage.

**Technical Execution:**
> Built Floyo from idea to production-ready system with comprehensive architecture, automated CI/CD, monitoring, security, and extensive documentation. Demonstrates ability to ship complex systems quickly and maintain high code quality.

**Product-Market Fit Understanding:**
> Extensive user research (ICP/JTBD analysis) shows deep understanding of target customers (Solo E-commerce Operators, Solo Full-Stack Developers) and their pain points. Privacy-first approach differentiates from competitors.

**Execution Evidence:**
> Floyo codebase demonstrates:
> - Full-stack capability (Python backend, TypeScript frontend, PostgreSQL database)
> - Production-ready infrastructure (monitoring, error tracking, analytics)
> - Security-first thinking (RLS policies, privacy controls)
> - Developer experience focus (comprehensive docs, automated workflows)
> - Previous automation tools (MASTER OMEGA PRIME, Aurora Prime) show pattern of building tools that solve real problems
