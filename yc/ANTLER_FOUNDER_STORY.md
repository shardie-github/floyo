## How We Discovered the Problem

### The Origin Story

[TODO: Founders to fill in their personal story]

**Example Template:**
> "We were building [Previous Project] and found ourselves juggling 15+ tools daily. We spent 2-3 hours per day manually syncing data between Shopify, Google Sheets, TikTok Ads, and our internal dashboards. We knew there had to be a better way, but existing tools either required too much configuration or didn't understand our actual workflow patterns.
>
> One day, [Founder Name] realized we were paying $300/month for tools we barely used, while manually doing work that could be automated. We started tracking our own file usage patterns and discovered we were missing obvious integration opportunities.
>
> That's when we realized: if we're experiencing this pain, thousands of other solo operators and developers must be too."
