**Last Updated:** 2025-01-20  
**Purpose:** Define the smallest testable version of Floyo and test results

---

## MVP Definition

### Core Value Proposition
The smallest testable version of Floyo tests: **"Can we discover 1 integration opportunity from file usage patterns?"**

### MVP Features
1. **File Usage Tracking:** Track which files users open/use
2. **Pattern Discovery:** Detect basic patterns (e.g., "User always opens file A then file B")
3. **Integration Suggestion:** Suggest 1 integration based on pattern
4. **User Feedback:** Allow users to accept/reject suggestion

### What's NOT in MVP
- [ ] Advanced pattern analysis
- [ ] Multiple integration suggestions
- [ ] Integration implementation
- [ ] Team features
- [ ] Advanced analytics

## MVP Test Plan

### Test Goal
Validate that users can discover integration opportunities from file usage patterns.

### Success Criteria
- **Time-to-Value:** Users see first suggestion within 2 days
- **"Aha Moment" Rate:** 60%+ of users experience "aha moment" (recognize value)
- **Retention:** 40%+ of users return after 7 days
- **Willingness to Pay:** 50%+ say they'd pay $29/month

### Test Duration
2-4 weeks with 10 beta users

### Test Method
1. Recruit 10 beta users (5 Solo E-commerce Operators, 5 Solo Full-Stack Developers)
2. Install Floyo CLI
3. Track file usage for 1 week
4. Show first integration suggestion
5. Measure: time-to-value, "aha moment", retention, willingness to pay
