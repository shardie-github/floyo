## Initial Wedge: Which Niche You're Starting With and Why

### The Wedge: Solo E-commerce Operators + Solo Developers

**Why This Niche:**

1. **High Pain, Willing to Pay**
   - E-commerce operators waste 2-3 hours/day on manual work = $1,500-$3,000/month value
   - Developers waste 30-45 min/day on context switching = $200-$400/month value
   - Both segments have budget for tools ($300-500/month for e-commerce, $200/month for developers)

2. **Clear ROI**
   - Time saved is measurable and valuable
   - Tool cost optimization is immediate (cancel unused subscriptions)
   - Integration suggestions provide concrete value (automated workflows)

3. **Viral Potential**
   - E-commerce operators share tools in communities (Shopify forums, TikTok creator groups)
   - Developers share tools on Twitter, Hacker News, Reddit
   - Integration suggestions create shareable content ("Look what Floyo suggested!")

4. **Defensible Entry Point**
   - Deep integration with specific tools (Shopify, TikTok Ads, Meta Ads, Zapier)
   - Pattern data becomes moat (more users = better suggestions)
   - Privacy-first positioning differentiates from competitors

**Why Not Start Broader:**
- Enterprise requires sales cycles, compliance, SSO (too slow)
- Generic productivity tools are crowded (too competitive)
- Single-tool focus limits value (too narrow)

### Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)

**Year 1 Target:**
- **E-commerce operators:** 1,000 users × $29/month = $348K ARR
- **Developers:** 5,000 users × $29/month = $1.74M ARR
- **Total Year 1:** **$2.1M ARR**

**Year 3 Target (10% of SAM):**
- **E-commerce operators:** 100K users × $29/month = $34.8M ARR
- **Developers:** 500K users × $29/month = $145M ARR
- **Total Year 3:** **$180M ARR**

**SOM:** $180M (Year 3)

## Bottom-Up Market Sizing

### Assumptions

**Year 1:**
- **Acquisition:** 6,000 users (500/month)
- **Conversion:** 20% free → paid = 1,200 paid users
- **ARPU:** $29/month = $348/year
- **ARR:** 1,200 × $348 = **$418K**

**Year 2:**
- **Acquisition:** 30,000 users (2,500/month)
- **Conversion:** 25% free → paid = 7,500 paid users
- **ARPU:** $29/month = $348/year
- **ARR:** 7,500 × $348 = **$2.6M**

**Year 3:**
- **Acquisition:** 150,000 users (12,500/month)
- **Conversion:** 30% free → paid = 45,000 paid users
- **ARPU:** $29/month = $348/year
- **ARR:** 45,000 × $348 = **$15.7M**

**Note:** This is conservative. If we add Enterprise tier ($100-500/month) and higher conversion rates, Year 3 could reach $50M+ ARR.

   - **Adjacent:** Team workflow optimization
   - **Expansion:** Team-level pattern analysis, workflow standardization
   - **Market Size:** $10B+ (Slack, Asana, Notion)

2. **Enterprise Developer Productivity**
   - **Current:** Solo developers
   - **Adjacent:** Enterprise engineering teams
   - **Expansion:** Team productivity metrics, tool ROI analysis
   - **Market Size:** $5B+ (GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, Jira)

3. **Business Process Automation**
   - **Current:** Developer/e-commerce workflows
   - **Adjacent:** All business processes

### Long-Term "Big Company" Vision

**"The Operating System for How People Work"**

Floyo becomes the intelligence layer that understands how individuals and teams actually work, then:
1. **Discovers patterns** across all tools and workflows
2. **Suggests optimizations** (integrations, automations, tool changes)
3. **Provides visibility** into productivity, tool usage, costs
4. **Connects tools** through integrations and automations
5. **Learns and improves** as more users contribute pattern data

**Analogies:**
- **Like Google Analytics for workflows** (not just web traffic, but all work)
- **Like Zapier but with discovery** (finds automations you didn't know existed)
- **Like GitHub but for tool stacks** (shares and optimizes tool configurations)

**Potential Outcomes:**
- **$1B+ company:** If we capture 1% of SAM ($100M ARR) and expand to adjacent markets
- **$10B+ company:** If we become the "operating system" for how people work
- **Acquisition target:** For companies like Zapier, GitHub, Atlassian, Microsoft
