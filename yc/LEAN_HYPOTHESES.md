# Lean Startup Hypotheses - Floyo

**Last Updated:** 2025-01-20  
**Purpose:** Document explicit hypotheses with test status, evidence, and next smallest tests

---

## Hypothesis Framework

For each hypothesis:
- **Hypothesis:** Clear statement
- **Test Status:** Untested / Partially Tested / Validated / Invalidated
- **Evidence:** Supporting data
- **Next Smallest Test:** Smallest test to validate/invalidate

---

## Problem Hypothesis

**Hypothesis:**
Solo E-commerce Operators and Solo Full-Stack Developers waste 2-3 hours/day manually syncing data between tools and miss integration opportunities because they don't know what's possible.

**Test Status:** [TODO: Untested / Partially Tested / Validated / Invalidated]

**Evidence:**
- [TODO: Link to user interviews]
- [TODO: Link to survey data]
- [TODO: Link to usage data]

**Next Smallest Test:**
Conduct 10 user interviews asking: "How many hours per day do you spend manually syncing data? Have you missed integration opportunities?"

---

## Customer Hypothesis

**Hypothesis:**
Solo E-commerce Operators are the best early adopters because they have high pain (2-3 hours/day manual work), clear ROI (time saved = money), and budget ($300-500/month for tools).

**Test Status:** [TODO: Untested / Partially Tested / Validated / Invalidated]

**Evidence:**
- [TODO: Link to beta test data]
- [TODO: Link to conversion data]

**Next Smallest Test:**
Run beta test with 20 Solo E-commerce Operators, measure activation rate and conversion to paid.

---

## Solution Hypothesis

**Hypothesis:**
Floyo's automatic pattern discovery and concrete integration suggestions will help users discover and implement integrations they didn't know were possible, saving them 10+ hours/week.

**Test Status:** [TODO: Untested / Partially Tested / Validated / Invalidated]

**Evidence:**
- [TODO: Link to usage data]
- [TODO: Link to survey data]

**Next Smallest Test:**
Beta test with 10 users, measure: time-to-value, "aha moment" rate, integrations implemented, time saved.

---

## Revenue Hypothesis

**Hypothesis:**
Users will pay $29/month for Pro plan because it saves them $1,500+/month in time value.

**Test Status:** [TODO: Untested / Partially Tested / Validated / Invalidated]

**Evidence:**
- [TODO: Link to pricing test data]
- [TODO: Link to conversion data]

**Next Smallest Test:**
Add pricing page with "Early Access" option, track: page views, signup attempts, drop-off points. Survey: "What would you pay?"

---

## Growth Hypothesis

**Hypothesis:**
Referral system will drive 30%+ of signups with viral coefficient > 1.2.

**Test Status:** [TODO: Untested / Partially Tested / Validated / Invalidated]

**Evidence:**
- [TODO: Link to referral data]

**Next Smallest Test:**
Launch referral system, track: referral signups, viral coefficient, conversion rate.

---

## Feature Hypothesis

**Hypothesis:**
[Feature Name] will increase [Metric] by [X]% because [Reason].

**Test Status:** [TODO: Untested / Partially Tested / Validated / Invalidated]

**Evidence:**
- [TODO: Link to feature usage data]

**Next Smallest Test:**
[TODO: Describe smallest test]

---
