**Last Updated:** 2025-01-20  
**Purpose:** Document explicit hypotheses with test methods, results, and status

## Hypothesis Framework

For each hypothesis, document:
- **Hypothesis:** Clear statement of what we're testing
- **Test Method:** How we'll test it
- **Success Criteria:** What success looks like
- **Test Status:** Untested / In Progress / Partially Tested / Validated / Invalidated
- **Results:** Actual results
- **Evidence:** Supporting data
- **Next Steps:** What to do next

## Core Hypotheses

### Problem Hypothesis

**Hypothesis:**
Solo E-commerce Operators and Solo Full-Stack Developers waste 2-3 hours/day manually syncing data between tools and miss integration opportunities because they don't know what's possible.

**Test Method:**
- User interviews (20+ interviews)
- Survey (100+ responses)
- Observation (track actual usage patterns)

**Success Criteria:**
- 80%+ of interviewees rate problem urgency 8+/10
- 70%+ report spending 2+ hours/day on manual work
- 60%+ report missing integration opportunities

**Test Status:** [TODO: Untested / In Progress / Partially Tested / Validated / Invalidated]

**Results:**
- [TODO: Fill in results]

**Evidence:**
- [TODO: Link to interview summaries]
- [TODO: Link to survey data]

**Next Steps:**
- [TODO: Next test or action]

### Customer Hypothesis

**Hypothesis:**
Solo E-commerce Operators are the best early adopters because they have high pain (2-3 hours/day manual work), clear ROI (time saved = money), and budget ($300-500/month for tools).

**Test Method:**
- User interviews (10+ Solo E-commerce Operators)
- Beta test (50+ Solo E-commerce Operators)
- Conversion tracking (signup → activation → paid)

**Success Criteria:**
- 70%+ activation rate for Solo E-commerce Operators
- 20%+ conversion to paid for Solo E-commerce Operators
- Higher activation/conversion than other segments

**Test Status:** [TODO: Untested / In Progress / Partially Tested / Validated / Invalidated]

**Results:**
- [TODO: Fill in results]

**Evidence:**
- [TODO: Link to beta test data]
- [TODO: Link to conversion data]

**Next Steps:**
- [TODO: Next test or action]

### Solution Hypothesis

**Hypothesis:**
Floyo's automatic pattern discovery and concrete integration suggestions will help users discover and implement integrations they didn't know were possible, saving them 10+ hours/week.

**Test Method:**
- Beta test (50+ users)
- Usage tracking (time saved, integrations implemented)
- User surveys (value perception)

**Success Criteria:**
- 60%+ of users implement at least 1 suggested integration
- Average time saved > 10 hours/week
- 80%+ of users report high value (8+/10)

**Test Status:** [TODO: Untested / In Progress / Partially Tested / Validated / Invalidated]

**Results:**
- [TODO: Fill in results]

**Evidence:**
- [TODO: Link to usage data]
- [TODO: Link to survey data]

**Next Steps:**
- [TODO: Next test or action]

### Revenue Hypothesis

**Hypothesis:**
Users will pay $29/month for Pro plan (unlimited tracking, all integrations, 90-day retention) because it saves them $1,500+/month in time value.

**Test Method:**
- Pricing page test (different price points)
- Willingness-to-pay survey (100+ responses)
- Conversion tracking (free → paid)

**Success Criteria:**
- 50%+ of users say they'd pay $29/month
- 20%+ conversion rate from free to paid
- LTV:CAC > 3:1

**Test Status:** [TODO: Untested / In Progress / Partially Tested / Validated / Invalidated]

**Results:**
- [TODO: Fill in results]

**Evidence:**
- [TODO: Link to pricing test data]
- [TODO: Link to conversion data]

**Next Steps:**
- [TODO: Next test or action]

### Growth Hypothesis

**Hypothesis:**
Referral system (invite friends, get rewards) will drive 30%+ of signups with viral coefficient > 1.2 (each user brings 1.2+ new users).

**Test Method:**
- Referral system launch
- Track referral signups
- Calculate viral coefficient

**Success Criteria:**
- 30%+ of signups from referrals
- Viral coefficient > 1.2
- Referral conversion rate > 25%

**Test Status:** [TODO: Untested / In Progress / Partially Tested / Validated / Invalidated]

**Results:**
- [TODO: Fill in results]

**Evidence:**
- [TODO: Link to referral data]

**Next Steps:**
- [TODO: Next test or action]
