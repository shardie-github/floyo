## The Problem

Solo operators, freelancers, and small teams waste hours every week manually stitching together tools and workflows. You use Microsoft Word macros, Python scrapers, Dropbox moves, and countless other tools—but they don't talk to each other. You're left building one-off integrations or doing repetitive manual work.

**The Cost:** 5-10 hours/week lost to context switching and manual data moves. That's $200-400 CAD/week in lost productivity for a solo operator.

---

## The Solution

**floyo** is a local-first system app that learns from your actual file usage patterns and suggests concrete API integrations. It watches what you do, detects patterns, and says: *"This MS Word macro could be chained with last week's Python scraper and Dropbox move to create a new workflow—here's sample code."*

**No cloud. No vendor lock-in. No data leaves your machine.**

## Why Now

**Canada Context:**
- **Privacy-first mandate:** PIPEDA compliance demands local-first solutions
- **Solo economy growth:** 1.7M+ Canadians self-employed (StatsCan, 2023)
- **API maturity:** Most tools now have robust APIs, but integration is still manual
- **Developer tool adoption:** Python, automation scripts, and workflow tools are mainstream

**Market Timing:**
- Remote work normalized custom workflows
- Privacy concerns (GDPR, PIPEDA) drive demand for local-first tools
- Low-code/no-code movement created integration-aware users

---

## Who It's For

**Primary Persona: Solo Operators**
- Freelancers, consultants, side-gig founders
- Tech-savvy professionals who automate repetitive tasks
- Privacy-conscious users who want control over their data
- Users who work with files across multiple tools (Word, Python, Dropbox, APIs)

**Secondary Persona: Small Teams (2-5 people)**
- Small agencies managing client workflows
- Startups before hiring dedicated ops teams
- Remote teams needing lightweight automation

## How It Works

1. **Monitor** — floyo quietly watches your file system (configurable directories)
2. **Learn** — Detects patterns: temporal sequences, input/output relationships, file dependencies
3. **Suggest** — Proposes concrete API integrations with sample code
4. **Execute** — You approve and run workflows locally (no cloud required)

**Example Workflow:**
```
Detected Pattern:
- Every Monday: Word doc created → Python script runs → Dropbox folder updated

Suggested Integration:
- Chain Word macro → Python scraper → Dropbox API upload
- Sample code provided
- One-click approval to automate
```
