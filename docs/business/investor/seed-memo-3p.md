## Page 1: Problem & Solution

### The Problem

Solo operators, freelancers, and small teams waste 5-10 hours per week manually moving data between tools and building one-off integrations. Existing solutions (Zapier, Make) are cloud-first (privacy concerns), expensive ($20-50 CAD/month), and lack file system awareness.

**Market Opportunity:**
- 1.7M+ Canadians self-employed (StatsCan, 2023)
- Growing privacy concerns (PIPEDA, GDPR)
- API maturity enables automation, but integration is still manual

### The Solution

**floyo** is a local-first workflow automation tool that:
- Monitors file system usage patterns (local processing)
- Detects workflow patterns (temporal sequences, file relationships)
- Suggests API integrations with sample code
- Executes workflows locally (no cloud dependency)

**Key Differentiators:**
- Local-first architecture (PIPEDA compliant, privacy-first)
- File system awareness (cross-tool pattern detection)
- Affordable pricing ($12 CAD/month vs. $20-50 for competitors)
- Developer + non-developer friendly (sample code provided)
