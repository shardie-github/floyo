# READY: Referral Program Implementation

**Priority:** P1  
**Owner:** Growth Lead  
**Status:** Ready  
**Effort:** Medium (5 days)  
**Impact:** Medium

## Problem Statement

No referral mechanism exists. CAC is high because all growth is paid.

## Success Criteria

- Referral rate >10% of signups
- Referral CAC <$10 (vs $50 paid CAC)
- Referral retention >40% (vs 25% average)

## Implementation Plan

1. **Day 1:** Design referral flow (share link → signup → reward)
2. **Day 2:** Implement referral tracking (unique links, attribution)
3. **Day 3:** Build referral dashboard (shares, signups, rewards)
4. **Day 4:** Implement rewards (1 month free for referrer + referee)
5. **Day 5:** Test + deploy

## 30-Day Signal

- 10%+ of signups from referrals
- Referral CAC <$10
- Referral retention >40%

## Dependencies

- Analytics infrastructure (to track referrals)
- Billing system (to apply rewards)
- Email system (to send referral invites)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Unique referral links generated
- [ ] Referral attribution tracked
- [ ] Rewards applied automatically (1 month free)
- [ ] Referral dashboard shows metrics
- [ ] Email invites sent to contacts

## Notes

Referrals have lower CAC and higher retention. This is a high-leverage growth channel.
