# READY: Retention Email Campaigns

**Priority:** P1  
**Owner:** Growth Lead  
**Status:** Ready  
**Effort:** Low (2 days)  
**Impact:** High

## Problem Statement

No retention campaigns exist. Users churn without re-engagement.

## Success Criteria

- D7 retention >25%
- Email open rate >30%
- Click-through rate >5%

## Implementation Plan

1. **Day 1:** Design email templates (D1 welcome, D7 value reminder, D30 check-in)
2. **Day 2:** Implement email triggers (based on user actions + time)

## 30-Day Signal

- Email open rate >30%
- D7 retention improved (target: >25%)
- Click-through rate >5%

## Dependencies

- Email system (SendGrid/existing)
- Analytics infrastructure (to track opens/clicks)
- User database (exists)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] D1 welcome email sent
- [ ] D7 value reminder email sent (if no activity)
- [ ] D30 check-in email sent
- [ ] Email open/click tracking implemented
- [ ] Unsubscribe flow works

## Notes

Retention multiplies LTV. Small improvements in retention have large impact on unit economics.
