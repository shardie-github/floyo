## Sales Scripts

### Opening Script

**Cold Email Template:**
```
Subject: Save 5-10 hours/week automating workflows (local-first, privacy-compliant)

Hi [NAME],

I noticed you're [CONTEXT] and thought floyo might help.

floyo is a local-first workflow automation tool that:
- Saves 5-10 hours/week automating repetitive tasks
- Processes everything locally (PIPEDA compliant)
- Costs $12 CAD/month (vs. $20-50 for competitors)

Interested in a quick demo?

Best regards,
[YOUR-NAME]
```

## Objection Handling

### Objection 1: "Too Expensive"

**Response:**
"floyo pays for itself with 1 hour saved/week (assuming $30 CAD/hour opportunity cost). Starter tier is $12 CAD/month—that's 40% cheaper than Zapier. Plus, you get local-first privacy, which competitors don't offer."

### Objection 2: "Privacy Concerns"

**Response:**
"floyo processes everything locally—no cloud dependency, no data exposure. We're PIPEDA compliant, and you can export or delete your data anytime. Your files never leave your device."

### Objection 3: "Already Using Zapier"

**Response:**
"floyo complements Zapier by offering local-first processing for file operations. Plus, we're 40% cheaper and provide file system awareness that Zapier doesn't offer. You can use both—floyo for local workflows, Zapier for cloud integrations."

### Objection 4: "Not Technical Enough"

**Response:**
"floyo provides sample code for all integrations—you don't need to be a developer. Just approve suggestions and workflows run automatically. We also have tutorials and support to help you get started."
