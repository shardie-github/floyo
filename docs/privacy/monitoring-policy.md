# Privacy-First Monitoring (Your Data, Your Rules)

## Purpose

We offer optional, privacy-first monitoring to help you improve daily workflows. It analyzes only the signals you explicitly enable to surface patterns and suggestions. Monitoring is OFF by default.

## What We Collect

• Only the apps and signals you turn on.  
• We never record passwords, message contents, screenshots, or keystrokes.  
• By default, we collect metadata (e.g., durations, focus switches) and redact sensitive fields.

## Control & Transparency

• You can turn monitoring ON/OFF anytime.  
• You can allow or block specific apps and signals.  
• A transparency log shows when data was collected, accessed by you, exported, or deleted.

## Security

• Your telemetry is encrypted and stored under your account.  
• Multi-factor authentication is required to view sensitive telemetry, export, or delete.  
• No staff or administrators can view your telemetry.

## Data Retention

• You choose how long to keep data (default 14 days). Older data is automatically deleted.

## Your Rights

• Export your data anytime.  
• Delete your data anytime.  
• If you have questions, contact support; we'll respond within 30 days.

## Changes

• We'll notify you before making material changes to this policy and ask for consent again if required.
