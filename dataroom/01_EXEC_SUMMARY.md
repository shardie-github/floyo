# Executive Summary - Floyo

**Date:** 2025-01-20  
**Status:** Draft - Founders to fill in real metrics

---

## One-Sentence Pitch

Floyo automatically tracks how developers and teams use files and tools, then uses AI to suggest integrations and automations that eliminate manual work and optimize workflows.

---

## Problem

Developers and small business operators juggle 10-20+ tools daily, wasting hours manually syncing data and missing integration opportunities. Solo e-commerce operators spend 2-3 hours/day on manual work worth $1,500-$3,000/month in time value.

---

## Solution

Floyo runs quietly in the background, tracking file and tool usage patterns, then suggests concrete integrations (Zapier workflows, API connections, automations) based on actual usage—not generic examples.

**Key Differentiators:**
- Automatic pattern discovery (no manual logging)
- Privacy-first (metadata only, never file content)
- Concrete suggestions with actual code
- Works across all tools

---

## Market

- **TAM:** $5B (developer productivity tools)
- **SAM:** $2.5B (small business automation)
- **SOM:** $125M (Solo e-commerce operators + Solo developers)

**Initial Wedge:** Solo E-commerce Operators and Solo Full-Stack Developers
