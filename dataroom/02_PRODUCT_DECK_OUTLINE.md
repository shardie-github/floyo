# Product Deck Outline - Floyo

**Purpose:** Outline for investor pitch deck

---

## Slide 1: Title Slide
- **Floyo Logo**
- **Tagline:** "Discover hidden connections in your workflow"
- **Founder Names**
- **Date**

---

## Slide 2: The Problem
- **Visual:** Person juggling 10+ tools
- **Key Points:**
  - Developers/small businesses use 10-20+ tools daily
  - 2-3 hours/day wasted on manual work
  - Missing integration opportunities
  - Paying for unused tools
- **Stat:** "$300-500/month on overlapping tools"

---

## Slide 3: Current Solutions Don't Work
- **Manual Time Trackers:** Require manual entry, don't suggest integrations
- **Generic Analytics:** Don't understand developer workflows
- **IDE Plugins:** Single-tool focused, can't connect across tools
- **Automation Platforms (Zapier):** Require you to know what to automate

**Gap:** No tool automatically discovers integration opportunities from actual usage.

---

## Slide 4: Our Solution
- **Visual:** Floyo dashboard showing integration suggestions
- **How It Works:**
  1. Tracks file/tool usage automatically
  2. Discovers patterns (e.g., "always run script then upload to Dropbox")
  3. Suggests concrete integrations with actual code
- **Key Differentiators:**
  - Automatic (no manual logging)
  - Privacy-first (metadata only)
  - Concrete suggestions (not generic advice)

---

## Slide 5: Demo / How It Works
- **Visual:** Screenshot or demo video
- **User Journey:**
  1. Install Floyo CLI
  2. Floyo watches usage patterns
  3. Dashboard shows integration suggestions
  4. User clicks "Set up integration"
  5. Integration is live in 10 minutes
- **Result:** Saves 30-50 hours/month
