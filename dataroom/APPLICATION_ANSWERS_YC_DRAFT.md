# YC Application Answers - Draft

**Purpose:** Draft answers to typical YC application questions

**Last Updated:** 2025-01-20

## 1. What does your company do?

Floyo automatically tracks how developers and teams use files and tools, then uses AI to suggest integrations and automations that eliminate manual work and optimize workflows.

**One sentence:** Floyo watches your actual file and tool usage patterns, then suggests concrete integrations (Zapier workflows, API connections, automations) based on what you actually do—not generic examples.

See: `/yc/YC_PRODUCT_OVERVIEW.md`

---

## 2. What is your company going to make?

A privacy-first workflow intelligence platform that:
- Automatically tracks file/tool usage patterns (no manual logging)
- Discovers integration opportunities you didn't know existed
- Suggests concrete integrations with actual code you can use
- Helps you optimize your tool stack and eliminate redundant subscriptions

**Key Differentiators:**
- Automatic discovery (vs. manual setup)
- Privacy-first (metadata only, never file content)
- Developer-focused (code examples, not just UI)

See: `/yc/YC_PRODUCT_OVERVIEW.md`

## 3. Why will you succeed?

**Founder-Market Fit:**
> **TODO:** Founders to fill in why this team is uniquely qualified

**Technical Moat:**
- More users = more pattern data = better suggestions (network effects)
- Privacy-first positioning differentiates from competitors
- Developer-focused approach creates deep integration with workflows

**Market Timing:**
- Developers/small businesses drowning in tools (10-20+ tools daily)
- Manual work waste is measurable ($1,500-$3,000/month in time value)
- Privacy-conscious users want alternatives to data-heavy tools

See: `/yc/YC_DEFENSIBILITY_NOTES.md`, `/yc/YC_TEAM_NOTES.md`

## 4. Who are your competitors, and what makes you different?

**Direct Competitors:**
- Zapier, Make, n8n (automation platforms)
- **Difference:** We automatically discover integration opportunities (they require manual setup)

**Indirect Competitors:**
- Manual time trackers (RescueTime, Toggl)
- IDE plugins (single-tool focused)
- **Difference:** We work across all tools and suggest concrete integrations

**Our Advantage:**
- Automatic discovery from actual usage
- Privacy-first (metadata only)
- Developer-focused (code examples)

See: `/yc/YC_MARKET_VISION.md` (Competitive Analysis section)
