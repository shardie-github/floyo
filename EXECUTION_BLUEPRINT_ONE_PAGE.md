# Floyo Execution Blueprint - One Page Summary

**Goal:** Transform Floyo from late prototype → real product with validated PMF, paying customers, and path to scale  
**Timeline:** 6-7 months to $25K MRR  
**Status:** Ready to execute

## 🎯 The Product

**Problem:** Developers waste 20-30% of time on context switching, struggle to discover tools, lack workflow visibility  
**Solution:** Privacy-first automatic pattern tracking + AI-powered integration suggestions  
**Audience:** Individual developers (primary), teams (secondary), enterprises (tertiary)  
**Current State:** Late prototype / Early beta - technically sophisticated, PMF unvalidated
