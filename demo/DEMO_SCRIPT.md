## Opening (30 seconds)

> "Hi, I'm Scott Hardie, Founder, CEO & Operator of Floyo. Floyo helps developers and small business operators discover integration opportunities they didn't know existed. Let me show you how it works."

---

## Landing Page

> "This is our landing page. The key message: We automatically discover integration opportunities from your actual file usage - no manual setup required."

---

## Sign Up

> "Sign up takes 30 seconds. We'll track your file usage patterns automatically - privacy-first, we only track metadata, never file content."

---

## Onboarding

> "Floyo runs in the background, watching which files you open and which tools you use. We discover patterns you didn't notice."

---

## Pattern Discovery

> "Here's a pattern Floyo discovered: You always run `process_orders.py` and then manually upload the output to Dropbox. This happens every morning at 9 AM."

---

## Integration Suggestion

> "Floyo suggests a concrete integration: A Zapier workflow that automatically uploads processed orders to Dropbox. Not generic advice - actual code you can use."

---

## Setup Integration

> "Setting up this integration takes 10 minutes. Floyo provides the Zapier workflow JSON and Python script modifications. You just copy and paste."

---

## Aha Moment

> "This integration saves you 30 minutes every day. That's 10 hours per month - worth $1,000-$2,000 in time value. And Floyo found 3 more integration opportunities."

---

## Closing

> "This is the value: Discovering automations you didn't know were possible, based on your actual usage. No guessing, no generic advice - just real suggestions that save time and money."
