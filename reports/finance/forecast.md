## Revenue Forecast

| Metric | Month 1 | Month 3 (Base) | Month 3 (Opt) | Month 3 (Cons) |
|--------|---------|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| **MRR** | $5,000 | $15,000 | $25,000 | $8,000 |
| **ARR** | $60,000 | $180,000 | $300,000 | $96,000 |

| **New Customers/mo** | 50 | 100 | 150 | 40 |
| **MoM Growth** | 0% | 15% | 25% | 10% |

## Unit Economics

| Metric | Base | Optimistic | Conservative |
|--------|------|------------|--------------|
| **CAC** | $50 | $30 | $80 |
| **LTV** | $300 | $600 | $150 |
| **LTV:CAC** | 6:1 | 20:1 | 1.9:1 |
| **Payback Period** | 1 month | 0.6 months | 1.6 months |

**Key Drivers:**
- **CAC:** Referrals reduce CAC (optimistic: 40% referrals = $30 CAC)
- **LTV:** Retention multiplies LTV (optimistic: 40% D7 retention = 12mo LTV)

## Cash & Runway

| Metric | Month 1 | Month 3 (Base) | Month 3 (Opt) | Month 3 (Cons) |

## Key Metrics & Targets

| Metric | Current | Target (30d) | Target (90d) |
|--------|---------|--------------|--------------|

## Sensitivity Analysis

**What if activation rate increases from 40% to 60%?**
- New customers/month: +50% (150 vs 100)
- MRR Month 3: $22,500 (vs $15,000 base)
- Cash runway: +0.5 months

**What if retention improves from 25% to 40% D7?**
- LTV: $600 (vs $300 base)
- LTV:CAC: 20:1 (vs 6:1 base)
- Payback period: 0.6 months (vs 1 month)

**What if referrals drive 40% of signups?**
- CAC: $30 (vs $50 base)
- LTV:CAC: 10:1 (vs 6:1 base)
- Cash runway: +0.3 months

## Recommendations

1. **Week 1-2:** Implement activation funnel (target: 40% activation)
2. **Week 2-3:** Launch retention campaigns (target: 25% D7 retention)
3. **Week 3-4:** Launch referral program (target: 10% referral rate)
4. **Month 2:** Raise capital if runway <3 months
5. **Month 3:** Review + iterate based on data

**Confidence:** Medium (model based on assumptions, needs validation with real data)
