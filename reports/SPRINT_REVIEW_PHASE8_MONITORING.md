# Phase 8: Continuous Monitoring Mode

**Generated:** 2025-01-XX  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Scope:** Continuous monitoring setup and follow-up task generation

---

## Continuous Monitoring Setup

### Monitoring Infrastructure

**Current State:** ✅ Good
- Sentry integration exists
- PostHog analytics exists
- Health check endpoints exist
- Logging infrastructure exists

**Enhancements Needed:**
- Performance monitoring (APM)
- Distributed tracing
- Error alerting
- Performance dashboards

---

## Automated Follow-Up Task Generation

### Task Generation Rules

**Trigger Events:**
1. New file created
2. Major file edited
3. Dependency added
4. Environment variables changed
5. New sprint started
6. User requests review
7. Every 24 hours (consistency check)

**Task Types:**
- Code quality improvements
- Security enhancements
- Performance optimizations
- Test coverage gaps
- Documentation updates

## Automated Alerts

### Error Alerts

- Critical errors → Immediate notification
- High-priority errors → Notification within 1 hour
- Medium-priority errors → Daily summary
- Low-priority errors → Weekly summary

### Performance Alerts

- API latency >500ms → Alert
- Dashboard load time >2s → Alert
- Error rate >2% → Alert
- Uptime <99% → Alert

### Security Alerts

- Dependency vulnerabilities → Alert
- Authentication failures spike → Alert
- Authorization failures → Alert
- Security header issues → Alert

---

## Monitoring Dashboard

### Recommended Metrics

1. **System Health**
   - Uptime percentage
   - Error rate
   - Response time (p50, p95, p99)
   - Request rate

2. **Code Quality**
   - Test coverage percentage
   - Linter error count
   - Type error count
   - Code complexity

3. **Performance**
   - API latency by endpoint
   - Dashboard load time
   - Database query performance
   - Cache hit rate

4. **Security**
   - Authentication success rate
   - Authorization failures
   - Dependency vulnerabilities
   - Security scan results
