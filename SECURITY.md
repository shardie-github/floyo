# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively maintain and provide security updates for the latest stable release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities through **GitHub Security Advisories**:

1. Go to the repository's Security tab
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the security advisory form

**Do not** open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

## Security Best Practices

- **No secrets in repository**: Never commit API keys, passwords, tokens, or other sensitive credentials
- **Immediate rotation**: If you suspect a credential has been exposed, rotate it immediately
- **Dependency updates**: Keep dependencies updated to patch known vulnerabilities
- **Principle of least privilege**: Use the minimum permissions required for each service

## Responsible Disclosure

We appreciate responsible disclosure. We will:
- Acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
- Provide an initial assessment within 7 days
- Work with you to coordinate a fix and disclosure timeline
- Credit you (if desired) in security advisories

## Security Contacts

For urgent security matters, tag maintainers in GitHub Issues with the `security` label.
